To reduce a 5\,V signal to 2\,V at 500\,Hz using a first-order RC low-pass filter, we need to determine the cutoff frequency \( f_c \) such that the filter attenuates the signal appropriately.

For a first-order RC low-pass filter, the gain at frequency \( f \) is given by:

\[
|H(f)| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{f}{f_c} \right)^2 }}
\]

We require:

\[
|H(500\,\text{Hz})| = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4
\]

Solving for \( f_c \):

\[
0.4 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{500}{f_c} \right)^2 }}
\]

\[
\sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{500}{f_c} \right)^2 } = \frac{1}{0.4} = 2.5
\]

\[
1 + \left( \frac{500}{f_c} \right)^2 = 6.25
\]

\[
\left( \frac{500}{f_c} \right)^2 = 5.25
\]

\[
\frac{500}{f_c} = \sqrt{5.25} \approx 2.291
\]

\[
f_c = \frac{500}{2.291} \approx \boxed{218.3\,\text{Hz}}
\]

Therefore, the filter should be designed with a cutoff frequency of approximately 218\,Hz to achieve the desired attenuation at 500\,Hz.
