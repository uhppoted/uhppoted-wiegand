# Fritzing's Lament_

_\<sigh\> ... : 

_How many times must a man shuffle his
Breadboard layout again?
And how many wires must be trim'd and cut
Before no connection is unsound?
Oh, how many times will the LEDs be
Completely the wrong way around?
The answer, my friend
Is blowing in the wind...
The answer is blowin' in the wind!_

_Oh, how many years can a bug lurk and hide
Before it comes to the fore?
And how many years can some people exist
Happily ignorant of circuitry 
Oh, how many times must a man type ===
Before val is really truthy?
The answer, my friend
Is blowing in the wind...
The answer is blowin' in the wind!_

_And how many times can a man hook up
VSS straight to the GND?
And recalculate the series resistance
So that the relays don't fry?
Oh, how many times must a man palm his face
And ask "Oh god, f&@*&%@ why???"
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
The answer is blowin' in the wind._
