# TODO

## PCB
    - [x] Replace SMD TranzOrbs with through-hole (for hand soldering)
    - [ ] DC converter module
    - [ ] Use ISO7843 to drive WS2812
    - [ ] Lose the TX/RX jumpers and connect both UARTs
    - (?) Put ISOW7842 on 'other' side of RP2040
    - [ ] Check M5 stack TX/RX voltage levels
    - [ ] Fix courtyard for RP2040 (should only surround actual pins)
    - [ ] Change footprint for off-board connector
    - [ ] 3D model for Molex connector
    - [ ] Logo + revision
    - [ ] Check inductor selection
