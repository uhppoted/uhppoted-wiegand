# M5Stack Wiegand Emulator

RP2040 _M5Stack_ module to emulate a Wiegand reader:

- Emulates a single Wiegand-26 card reader/keypad with an LED. 
- Implements the M5Stack serial interface.
- Intended for use with an M5 _base_ module but can optionally be powered via the external connector
  for standalone use.

## Raison d'Ãªtre

Mostly to avoid having to dig out a breadboard and figure how it worked all over again every time I needed
to test a Wiegand interface.

## Status
