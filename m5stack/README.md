# M5Stack Wiegand Emulator

RP2040 _M5 Stack_ module to emulate a Wiegand reader:

- Emulates a single Wiegand-26 card reader/keypad with an LED. 
- Implements the M5 stack serial interface.
- Intended for use with an M5 _base_ module but can optionally be powered via the external connector
  for standalone use.

## Raison d'Ãªtre

Mostly because I got tired of digging out a breadboard and trying to remember how it all worked every time
I needed to test a Wiegand interface :-).
