# uhppoted-wiegand

`uhppoted-wiegand` implements a _Raspberry Pi Pico_ reader/emulator for a Wiegand-26 interface.

The project is **mostly** a just-for-fun exploration of the capabilities of the RP2040 PIO but could also 
be useful as a basis for:

- testing and debugging
- interfacing non-standard/off-brand readers and keypads to the UHPPOTE L0x access controllers

The project includes:
- PIO based Wiegand-26 reader emulator which can write a Wiegand-26 card out to a controller
- PIO based Wiegand-26 controller emulator which can read from Wiegand-26 reader and unlock a door
- PIO based Wiegand-26 'universal' reader/writer implementation

## Raison d'Ãªtre

The RP2040 PIO is an intriguing peripheral and this project was an excuse to explore its capabilities and
limitations. Wiegand-26 is particularly simple protocol and does not even begin to push the boundaries of
the PIO but the code and associated information may be useful for other things.

## Status

Breadboarded and Fritzing'ed implementations of:
- Wiegand-26 reader emulator
- Wiegand-26 controller emulator
- Wiegand-26 'universal' reader/writer

Next up:
- Wiegand-26 relay
- (maybe) KiCad schematics

### Building from source

Required tools:
- [Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf)
- Compatible C/C++ compiler
- _make_
- [PicoProbe](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe) (optional but recommended)
- [OpenOCD](https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd.git) (optional but recommended)
- [PicoTool](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool) (optional but recommended)

To build using the included _Makefile_:
```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-wiegand.git
cd uhppoted-wiegand/pico
make clean
make build
```

The `build` target produces both a UF2 and an ELF binary for installation on a _Raspberry Pi Pico_ using either:
- USB (using _BOOTSEL_)
- _PicoProbe_ + _OpenOCD_
- _PicoTool_

- The `make install` command installs the binary using _PicoTool_
- The `make run` command installs the binary using _PicoProbe_ and _OpenOCD_

## Usage

The provided software includes a **very** bare bones serial port command interface. Commands are (currently)
single letter mnemonics and need to be terminated by a carriage return and/or line feed.

## Operating Modes

The code supports two operating modes:
- emulator/writer
- controller/reader

In _emulator_ mode the implementation writes a Wiegand-26 card code (or keypad PIN code) to an external Wiegand-26 interface
(e.g. a UHPPOTE controller). It also:
- emulates a door open/closed sensor
- emulates a door pushbutton
- detects the door locked/unlocked state

In _controller_ mode the implementation reads a Wiegand-26 card code (or keypad PIN code) from an external Wiegand-26 reader/keypad. It also:
- detects a door open/closed sensor state change
- detects a door pushbutton state change
- emulates a door lock/unlock
- implements card permissions and keypad passcodes

The operating mode is set by the combination of the code and the JUMPER_READ and JUMPER_WRITE inputs (set in _hwconfig.c_, 
GPIO7 and GPIO8 by default):
- the _controller_ binaries expect the JUMPER_READ input to be pulled LOW
- the _emulator_ binaries expected the JUMPER_WRITE input to be pulled LOW
- the _universal_ binaries start in _reader_ mode if the JUMPER_READ input is pulled LOW, or in _writer_ mode if the 
  JUMPER_WRITE is pulled LOW
- if both JUMPER_READ and JUMPER_WRITE are pulled LOW the operating mode is UNKNOWN.

## Build constants

The _build constants_ in the _Makefiles_ define the initial operational settings:
