# uhppoted-wiegand

`uhppoted-wiegand` implements a _Raspberry Pi Pico_ reader/emulator for a Wiegand-26 interface.

The project is **mostly** a just-for-fun exploration of the capabilities of the RP2040 PIO but could also 
be useful as a basis for:

- testing and debugging
- interfacing non-standard/off-brand readers and keypads to the UHPPOTE L0x access controllers

The project includes:
- PIO based Wiegand-26 reader
- PIO based Wiegand-26 emulator
- _basic_ serial port command interface
- _(in progress) KiCad schematic for breadboard prototypes_

## Raison d'Ãªtre

The RP2040 PIO is an intriguing peripheral and this project was an excuse to explore its capabilities and
limitations. Wiegand-26 is particularly simple protocol and does not even begin to push the boundaries of
the PIO but maybe the code and associated information will be useful for other things.

## Status

_-- IN DEVELOPMENT --_

## Releases

## Installation

### Building from source

Required tools:
- [Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf)
- Compatible C/C++ compiler
- _make_
- [PicoProbe](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe) (optional but recommended)
- [OpenOCD](https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd.git) (optional but recommended)
- [PicoTool](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool) (optional but recommended)

To build using the included _Makefile_:
```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-wiegand.git
cd uhppoted-wiegand/pico
make clean
make build
```

The `build` target produces both a UF2 and an ELF binary for installation on a _Raspberry Pi Pico_ using either:
- USB (using _BOOTSEL_)
- _PicoProbe_ + _OpenOCD_
- _PicoTool_

- The `make install` command installs the binary using _PicoTool_
- The `make run` command installs the binary using _PicoProbe_ and _OpenOCD_

#### Dependencies

| *Dependency*                                                    | *Description*                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
|                                                                 |                                     |
|                                                                 |                                     |

## Usage

The provided software includes a **very** bare bones serial port command interface. Commands are (currently)
single letter mnemonics and need to be terminated by a carriage return and/or line feed.

The supported command set comprises:

| *Command*              | *Description*                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| O                      | Turns on the reader LED                 |
| X                      | Turns off the reader LED                |
| Q                      | Retrieves the last read card (if any)   |
| Tyyyy-mm-dd HH:mm:ss   | Sets the Pico date and time             |
| Wnnnnnnnnn             | Writes a card number out as Wiegand-26  |

Notes:
1. The default facility code for _emulator_ mode is a build time constant (`FACILITY_CODE` in the _Makefile_) and will
be used if the _W_ command card number is 5 digits or less.
